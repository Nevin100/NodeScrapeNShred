## 💥 What is this cursed thing?
Welcome to **NodeScrapeNShred** — the most **violently educational** repo you'll find on the art of **web scraping** using **Node.js**, **Cheerio**, and **Axios**.

Whether you're trying to extract some spicy article titles or just flex on websites that never gave you an API key – THIS is your dojo. 🥷

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack of Doom:
- 💻 **Node.js** – The muscle.
- 🧽 **Cheerio** – Because jQuery didn’t deserve to die.
- 🌐 **Axios** – Fetches faster than your college WiFi.

## 🎯 Why This Exists
Because scraping data the right way is boring.  
This repo is for learning the **dirty, quick, and effective** way of getting what you need from a web page.  

Use it to:
- 🔍 Practice DOM traversal like a web ninja
- 🚀 Get fundamental hands-on with Cheerio selectors
- 🧠 Understand HTTP requests in Node
- 💡 Build muscle memory for scraping before you hit the real stuff (like Puppeteer, Playwright, or Selenium Hell™)
